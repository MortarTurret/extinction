HOW CAN I EDIT THE MOD? 
-Open the TA Modding folder.
-All of the .cs files are split into named folders for convenience

-There are two easy ways you can format your mods' files in the 'TotalAnnihilation' folder
-One way is to have all of the .cs files in the folder and the other is to compress them into a single scripts.vol file in the folder instead

-If you need to grab all the .cs files out of the TA Modding folders simply open TA Modding and search for *
-Scroll down in the search passed the folders and select the first .cs file and then scroll to the bottom and select the last to highlight all 304.cs files
-You can now just copy and paste them wherever, for example into the 'TotalAnnihilation' folder.

-With the above method you can make edits to the mod while keeping the files 1) updated AND 2) in easily searchable folders.
-Another common option would be to just directly edit the .cs files inside the 'TotalAnnihilation' folder while you work on your mod and compile a scripts.vol later

-If you do want to compile your .cs files into a scripts.vol simply paste them all into
'Mod Compile Machine' folder, then run the 'TotalAnnihilation Mod Compile Machine' batch file.
-Press c to compile and it will create a new scripts.vol file that you can move to the 'TotalAnnihilation' folder.

You can also use the mod compile machine to decompile a scripts.vol
