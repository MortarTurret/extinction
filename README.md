# Tribes: Extinction
Extinction is a community-driven mod for Starsiege: Tribes based on [BaseEncrypt's](https://github.com/BaseEncrypt) [Total Annihilation mod](https://github.com/BaseEncrypt/TotalAnnihilation), focusing on the goal of driving community engagement and transparent development.

## Developer Guidelines
All commits should try to follow current [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standards when possible.

## Transparency Process
* All changes to this mod are broken down into one of two categories: Bug Fixes, and Community Updates.
* Bug Fixes don't introduce new behaviors or features, but only fix existing unintended behaviors or glitches.
* Community Updates do introduce new behaviours, items, or features, or impact that the game balance through adjustments to existing behaviors, items or features, and are based on Community Proposals.
* Only Community Proposals that have successfully passed community voting are to be added to the mod as Community Updates, with commit notation indicating the vote ratio as well as the vote rosters.
* Community Proposals that have a split vote (near-50%, based on voting numbers) will need to be redrafted in an attempt to find a compromise, with the redraft going up for a vote.
* If a Redrafted Community Proposal again reaches a split vote (near-50%, based on voting numbers), it will not be implemented.
* Community Proposals that have no votes will also not be implemented.
* Community Updates will be implemented based on voting traction, with more popular Community Proposals being implemented sooner.
